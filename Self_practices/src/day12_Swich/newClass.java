/*Warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.
        you get 3 int variables: n1 , n2 and n3 (none of them are equal)
            if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
            if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
            if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"
            example:
                    n1 = -2
                    n2  = 2
                    n3  = 1
                output: "n2 is bigger"
            NOTE: DO NOT USE IF STATEMENT
